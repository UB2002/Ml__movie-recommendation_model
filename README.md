# Ml__movie-recommendation_model

this is a good working movie recommendation model i created with the knowledge i have on machine learning it gives a pretty good recommendation based on simmlar title (close match to the tittle ) 
you can update it by finding close match by title,genere or director you can use other thing to find or give a better recommendation to the end user
