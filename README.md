# Ml__movie-recommendation_model

this is a good working movie recommendation model I created with the knowledge I have on machine learning it gives a pretty good recommendation based on a similar title (close match to the title) 
you can update it by finding close matches by title, genre or director you can use other things to find or give a better recommendation to the end user
